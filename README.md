## About the Experience
It's natural to feel stressed and anxious while at work when there are deadlines to be met. And at times this can trigger the effect of fast-paced thinking syndrome, where your head is filled with thoughts all the time, making it difficult for you to concentrate on solving everyday tasks.

During the pandemic, with the isolation process, many people came to experience minor attacks of "fast thinking syndrome" - and with that, there was a difficulty in explaining exactly why she feels so physically tired with something that happens only in her head.
